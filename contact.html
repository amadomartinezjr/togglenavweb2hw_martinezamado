      The most recent storm two weeks before had dropped three feet of snow, and there was still snow on the ground. But with high temperatures hovering around 50 degrees Fahrenheit for several days, a lot of it had melted. At the beginning of March, more than three weeks after our visit, I checked with a ranger at the Giant Forest Museum and learned that there was one more snowstorm in February, but it had been so warm since, with several days at 60 degrees, that there was no snowpack left in Giant Forest.

Nevertheless, as of the beginning of March the total snowfall for the season was already 162 inches at Giant Forest - double last yearâ€™s snowfall at that time, and higher than any of the previous four years. The ranger said that a few more snowstorms are expected this month, and it is possible that this could be the first year in five years that the snowpack in Giant Forest reaches its historic average of 240 inches for the season.

A walk on snowy trails among the ancient and majestic sequoias in early February was amazing despite their not being decorated with freshly fallen snow. The bark of the sequoias is a beautiful rich cinnamon color that contrasts with the less saturated hues of the rest of the forest. Their trunks loom massive and immense, up to 40 feet in diameter and 100 feet in circumference, with bark up to 31 inches thick. Some sequoia trees soar to more than 300 feet tall, their size hard to take in. The oldest sequoias are about 3,200 years old.
